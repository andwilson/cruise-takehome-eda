This repository takes a hypothetical autonomous vehicle startup data set, analyzes it, and offers business actions based on the results. The report is split into five major sections, each containing some background information, code (process/methodology), results, and recommendations:

- Setup, load, and clean — get dataset into a workable state
- Safety — reduce the number of near misses
- Ratings — causes of bad ratings and how to improve them
- Utilization — dive deep into quantifying the amount of empty car seats
- Pricing — current pricing structure and how to optimize it

It is structured as an R Notebook, which anyone should be able to download and run, as long as the packages at the top are installed in RStudio.
